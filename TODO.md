# FastAPI User Management

Since pydantic has a released version v2, there are some task we need to do for this project.

- [ ] Update from Pydantic v1 to v2
- [ ] Check for any major security leaks (like plain text password or token)
- [ ] Write tests for this code for future purposes (If you want to refactor code while writing test, you're free to do so.)
- [ ] Dockerize this project
